# knowledge_graphs_coursework

Worked on using the pizza onotology and dataset to create triple structures and build a graph that would be queryable through SPARQL. Manual work was reduced as much as possible by using SPARQL and dataframe manipulations to extract classes and create triples. Two different onotologies were also equivalenced mapped using string similarity and OWL2Vec was used for cosine similarity. 

For the embeddings using OWL2Vec, while the python notebook (Word Embeddings) has been uploaded, it will not run without additional scripts. This is a view only. The other notebook can be run.
